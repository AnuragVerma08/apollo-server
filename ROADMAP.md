# Apollo Server Roadmap

*Last updated: November 2021*

> **Please note:** This is an approximation of **larger effort** work planned for the next 3 - 6 months. It does not cover all new functionality that will be added, and nothing here is set in stone. Also note that each of these releases, and several patch/minor releases in-between, will include bug fixes (based on issue triaging) and community submitted PR's.

## 3.6

**Estimated release:** Q4 2021

* Usage reporting functionality and performance enhancements ([#5708](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/5708))

## 4.0

**Estimated release:** Q1 2022

- Significant `apollo-server-core` (will become `@apollo/server`) restructuring to introduce a new `ApolloServer` subclass based API, to make the project more easily extensible by both ourselves and the community
- `@defer` / `@stream` support ([#5893](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/5893))
